# Flyff Client made in Python
Just a fun project inspired by another flyff client to help me learn python :)

## Currently in development mode. 
If you can't figure out how to run it yourself then its not ready for you yet.

### Features :
- play flyff in window
- spawn new flyff windows until your computer explodes. There is no profiling yet so just stick to one.
- Exit the client

-- targeting through party frames by taking x,y coords from user input and mouseclicking around coordinates. not flexible but may work.
could use to untarget > self buff > target > continue buffing/healing
