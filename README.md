# Flyff Client made in Python

Just a fun project inspired by another flyff client to help me learn python :)

### Currently in development mode. 
If you can't figure out how to run it yourself then its not ready for you yet.

All this client will currently do:
    - ability to play flyff in window
    - ability to spawn new windows with risk of data corruption and severe consequencess as no profiling or limitations have been implemented
    - ability to exit
