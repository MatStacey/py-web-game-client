# Flyff Client made in Python
Just a fun project inspired by another flyff client to help me learn python :)

## Currently in development mode. 
If you can't figure out how to run it yourself then its not ready for you yet.

### Features :
- play flyff in window
- spawn new flyff windows until your computer explodes. There is no profiling yet so just stick to one.
- Execute Macro which executes action bar keys 1-9 and re-applies buffs when they expire, as long as they are in the order the client expects :):)::):). 
- Healing between between buff cooldowns. Will cast action bar slot instead of heal if target is enemy (eg holy cross spam ;))))))
- Exit the client from file menu
